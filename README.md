## Comparing clustering algorithms for news clustering in Farsi language

<br/>

### Preprocessing

We have used Hazm library for normalizing and tokenizing our data.
<br/>

### Clustering

We have used two algorithms, **K-means** and **Feature agglomeration** for clustering. Also, we have used two metrics to evaluate and compare the algorithems, **Davies-Bouldin Index** and **Silhouette Coefficient**.
